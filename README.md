# Standard-Deviation-and-error-calculator-
Calculates Standard deviation and error of a data set.

I need help changing the standard deviation and error calculator into something that ask for the user to input instead of defining the data in the code.

dataset = [6,9,12,14,18,22];
the code above is setting the dataset inside the code instead, make it so the user inputs the numbers themselves like below: 

dataset = input()
I want to take the input the user writes then calculate standard deviation and error.
